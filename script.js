    text: "Every year, I usually have a bunch of resolutions that I never keep up with. Last year, my resolution was to drink more water. But one thing remains constant, and that’s to follow a rigid schedule (which I never do). I’ve always struggled with schedules, and I have always admired you for strongly adhering to your daily agendas, and I’ve always found that fascinating about you. Also, one of the fondest memories I have of yours is during our excursion to Pondicherry. We were at Eden Beach, I was on an elevated state of mind, and everyone were clicking pictures and living their moments to their fullest, while I was doodling half assed diagrams that made no sense. We had a brief conversation about your experiences in school, and you told me about how judgemental some people could be, and I really cherished that intimate conversation we had."

    text: "Happiest Birthday Shanyaaa, The best part about you is that, even though you stay so far apart, when I text and ask you if are you free the next minute we are having a video call. Even though the time zones are different you make sure that you connect with me and make sure you’re there for me in my ups and downs. This is more than I can ask from a gem like you. May you have all the success and happiness in the world because you deserve it. Love you loads…"

    text: "I honestly feel like she would kill for me, like commit crimes. She will ALWAYS be on your side. She’s so easy to talk to about anything and everything, but especially the hard things. She makes you feel special and loved and does not let you forget it. Her sense of humor is insanely good and her laugh is contagious. She’s always down for a good time, or an okay time too. She’s content just sitting on the couch together. Her hugs are so warm :)I know she’ll be my friend for life."

    text: "It's difficult to ask someone to describe the best thing about their best friend. Because everything about Sharanya is the best. She's kind, independent, empathetic but stands up for herself and so much more. I am truly lucky to have met her and to grow up with her because I can see just how far she's come and I'm so proud of her. :) <br><br> I love you, Sharu. I know we grew up reading numerous books and watching countless romcoms that had a Happily Ever After and Greatest Love Story, but having you in my life, unflinchingly in my corner makes me think that our friendship is no less than the romance in these stories. And we can be like Lilly and Mia as we live out our own happily ever afters. ❣️ <br><br> Cannot wait to see you again and I miss you. 😭❤️ Loads and loads of love as you turn 25, and officially become a fully grown adult with a fully developed prefrontal cortex. ❤️❤️❤️"
